            Hello! I am Anubhooti Pandey, a passionate Frontend Developer with experience in building modern web applications. I specialize in using tools like ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to create visually stunning, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I am dedicated to delivering high-quality user experiences and ensuring that my designs work seamlessly across various devices.

            <p className="text-[16px] text-gray-400 mt-4">
            I am proficient in several frontend technologies such as Next.js, Shadcn UI, Material UI, and Ant Design, which allow me to craft aesthetically pleasing and highly functional web applications. I also have experience working with Redux for state management, enabling smooth data flow across applications. Additionally, I use Framer Motion for creating engaging animations and transitions that enhance the overall user experience.

            <p className="text-[16px] text-gray-400 mt-4">
            My toolbox also includes Bootstrap, which I use for quick prototyping and responsive designs, and TypeScript, which helps me write more reliable, type-safe code, ensuring scalability and maintainability in large applications. I'm constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends to ensure that my skills are aligned with industry standards.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[16px] text-gray-400 mt-4">
            I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on mastering full-stack development and exploring exciting areas like web performance optimization, progressive web apps (PWAs), and server-side rendering (SSR).
